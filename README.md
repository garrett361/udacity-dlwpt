# Udacity - Deep Learning with PyTorch
Collection of worked-out exercises (Jupyter/Colab notebooks) from Udacity's course(s) on PyTorch, modified to various degrees from the original assignments.

* `mnist_mlp_exercise`: Standard fully-connected MNIST intro.  The `Hello World` of ML.
* `cifar10_cnn_exercise`: Basic CIFAR10 classifier using CNNs.
* `Style_Transfer_Exercise_Alterations`: Style transfer à la [Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), modified somewhat from the original Udacity exercise.
* `{rnn, lstm, gru}_char_level`: Three character-level recurrent networks (`vanilla`, `lstm`, and `gru`), each trained on Webster's dictionary
* `Sentiment_RNN_Exercise`: Simple movie-review sentiment classifier.  Following the Udacity lesson here, which doesn't produce particularly good results.
